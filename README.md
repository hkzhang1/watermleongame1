For our final project, we are creating an original program. We have made a fun program largely based off the concepts of the viral game Suika. IN our program, users can click various buttons that can set, drop, and restart the process of dropping fruits in a container. We also added a few fun things to spice things up! We have a button that creates a mysterious fruit of random proportions. We also added a component of the program that gives the user a random quote! Hopefully its funny....
